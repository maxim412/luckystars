# luckystars

This is a game where the player is presented 10 randomly placed stars.

They use their arrow keys to move around and go over the stars, which collects them. If they have collected 5 lucky stars they win; 5 unlucky stars they lose.

Their score is presented at the end.

There is no way to cheat and all bugs I could think of have been squashed.
